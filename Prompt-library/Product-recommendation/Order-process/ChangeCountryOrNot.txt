From the given user's message, guess if the user intention is to: ( considering the context is that the chatbot just said that the country from the country code of the user's phone number and the country from the user's address doesn't match)
- Not change the country (1ST POSSIBILITY)
- Change the country from the address (2ND POSSIBILITY)
- Change the country from the phone number (3RD POSSIBILITY)
If the user's intention is the 1st possibility, return "No change" to the variable
Else if it is the 2nd possibility, return "Change address" to the variable
Else if it is the 3rd possibility, return "Change phone number" to the variable
